<p> Canción 1: Natural: Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happening?
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it
A bit of the truth, the truth
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood on my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Natural
Yeah, you're a natural

<p> Canción 2: Island: I'm on an island, dirty dancing in the sun
So close to heaven but so far from everyone
Yeah, I've got treasures buried underneath the sand
But I'm still wishing for all the love that I don't have
Mama told me, "Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em"
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sitting here wondering all day long
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
I can paint my toenails while I'm soaking up the sea
The only thing that's missing here is you and our TV
And I won't lie, it sure gets lonely here at night
But no one here needs nothing from me, and it's kinda nice
Mama told me, "Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em"
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sitting here wondering all day long
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
I hear your voice like a song on the radio
All day long 'cause, boy, I've been missing you
I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah
I hear your voice like a song on the radio
All day along, 'cause, boy, I've been missing you
I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed...

<p> Canción 3: Hearbeat: It leaves me feeling seasick, baby
꿈같은 현실 깊이 갇혔나 봐
It spins me round and drives me crazy
한낮에 뜬 달 같은 나인가 봐
만약 나 혼자였다면 혹시 널 몰랐다면
포기했을지 몰라 lost at sea
But my heart's still on fire with a burning desire
다시 널 찾을 거야 운명처럼
I wish that you would love (love) me (me)
어제처럼 다시 이 손 놓지 말고
And every time my heart (heart) beats (beats)
발맞춰봐 다시, 더는 헤매이지 않도록
운명을 느껴, 널, oh, oh-oh-널
운명을 느껴, 날, 날, 날-ah-날
When you hear my heartbeat, baby
You gave me a new life, you gave me a new birth
I feel you're heartbeat away
I been losin' my mind, I been cravin' my shine
I know me before you was a ready-made me
But you designate me and you did resume me
I been calling your name in this universe
(Now I need no space) I got youniverse, done
널 만난 건 (yeah) 이 우주가 빚어낸 한 편의 드라마 같아
수많았던 헤매임, 끝이 보이지가 않던 방황
그 미로 속에서 나를 이끌어준 너 (너)
너는 나의 빛이자 나의 구원 (원)
이 비도 그쳐가 이젠, 니 손을 놓지 않을래
I wish that you would love (love) me (me)
어제처럼 다시 이 손 놓지 말고
And every time my heart (heart) beats (beats)
발맞춰봐 다시 더는 헤매이지 않도록
운명을 느껴, 널, oh, oh-oh-널
운명을 느껴, 날, 날, 날-ah-날
운명을 느껴, 널, oh, oh-oh-널
운명을 느껴, 날, 날, 날-ah-날
My heart's on fire for your love
Oh, my heart's on fire for your love
I wish that you would love (love) me (me)
어제처럼 다시 이 손 놓지 말고 (말고)
And every time my heart (heart) beats (beats)
발맞춰봐 다시 더는 헤매이지 않도록
운명을 느껴, 널, oh, oh-oh-널
운명을 느껴, 날, 날, 날-ah-날
운명을 느껴, 널, 널, 널, 널, 널
운명을 느껴, 날, 날, 날, 날, 날
