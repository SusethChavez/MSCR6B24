<p> Cancion 1: MAKE IT RIGHT
내가 날 눈치챘던 순간
떠나야만 했어
난 찾아내야 했어 all day, all night
사막과 바다들을 건너
넓고 넓은 세계를
헤매어 다녔어
Baby I
I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
그 먼 길 위에서
Oh, you're the light
초대받지 못한
환영받지 못한
나를 알아줬던 단 한 사람
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh, I can make it right
Alright, alright
Oh oh, I can make it right
Alright, alright
Oh oh, I can make it right
이 세상 속에 영웅이 된 나
나를 찾는 큰 환호와 (right)
내 손, 트로피와 금빛 마이크
All day, everywhere
But 모든 게 너에게 닿기 위함인 걸 (oh)
내 여정의 답인 걸 (oh)
널 찾기 위해 노래해
Baby to you
전보다 조금 더 커진 키에
좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게
My rehab 날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
그 모든 길은 널 향한 거야
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
그때처럼 날 어루만져줘
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh, I can make it right
Alright, alright
Oh oh, I can make it right
Alright, alright
Oh oh, I can make it right
여전히 아름다운 너
그날의 그때처럼 말없이 그냥 날 안아줘
지옥에서 내가 살아 남은 건
날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아
Alright
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh oh, I can make it right
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
Oh oh, I can make it right
Alright, alright
Oh oh, I can make it right

<p> Cancion 2: ISLAND
I'm on an island, dirty dancing in the sun
So close to heaven but so far from everyone
Yeah, I've got treasures buried underneath the sand
But I'm still wishing for all the love that I don't have
Mama told me, "Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em"
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sitting here wondering all day long
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
I can paint my toenails while I'm soaking up the sea
The only thing that's missing here is you and our TV
And I won't lie, it sure gets lonely here at night
But no one here needs nothing from me, and it's kinda nice
Mama told me, "Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em"
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sitting here wondering all day long
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
I hear your voice like a song on the radio
All day long 'cause, boy, I've been missing you
I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah
I hear your voice like a song on the radio
All day along, 'cause, boy, I've been missing you
I hear your voice like a song on the radio, ah
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed in paradise?
Am I stranded on an island?
Or have I landed...

<p> Cancion 3: O CHILDREN
Pass me that lovely little gun
My dear, my darling one
The cleaners are coming, one by one
You don't even want to let them start
They're knocking now upon your door
They measure the room, they know the score
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
Of your broken little hearts
Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun
Here, take these before we run away
The keys to the gulag
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
They're gathering round with all my friends
We're older now, and the light is dim
And you are only just beginning
Oh, children
We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal-clear
It's roundabout and it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings
The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
And they're lining up to inspect you
Oh children
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
He's found the answer that we lost
We're all weeping now, weeping because
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station
And have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?
I'm hanging in there, don't you see?
In this process of elimination
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun (children)
It's beyond my wildest expectation (oh, children)
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
The train ain't even left the station (oh, children)
(Hey, little train, wait for me)
(I once was blind but now I see)
